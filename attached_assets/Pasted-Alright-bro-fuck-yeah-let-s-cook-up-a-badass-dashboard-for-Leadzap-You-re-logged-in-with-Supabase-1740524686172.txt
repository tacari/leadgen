Alright, bro—fuck yeah, let’s cook up a badass dashboard for Leadzap! You’re logged in with Supabase, and when users hit that /dashboard after login, it’s gotta slap ‘em with value—personalized, premium, and packed with everything to make this a $100k/month AI lead gen beast. No half-assing—full details, every section, deep dive, dark mode swagger, neon purple fire. Register/login’s on the back burner—we’re focusing on what they see post-login, starting with “Hey [Username]” to set the tone. Supabase is in play, so we’ll leverage it for user data. Let’s fucking go—here’s the full dashboard breakdown!
Dashboard Overview: What Users See Post-Login
The dashboard (dashboard.html) is the heart of Leadzap—where clients land after logging in via /login, powered by Flask on Replit with Supabase auth. It’s their control hub—showing AI-generated leads, subscription details, analytics, and delivery status—tied to their package (Lead Launch: $499, 50 leads; Empire: $5,999/month, 600 leads). It’s gotta be slick, intuitive, and scream “You’re getting your money’s worth”—keeping ‘em hooked for that $5k–$10k quick win and $100k/month grind. Dark mode (#0D1321 base, #7B00FF accents), Tailwind CSS, and dynamic data from Supabase make it pop.
Purpose

Engage: Filters, stats, controls—keep ‘em clicking, not bouncing.  
Upsell: Highlight their plan, tease bigger tiers—$499 to $5,999 upgrades.
