Lead History Page (/lead-history): Full Details
Overview
Purpose: Archive and manage all leads—beyond the dashboard’s latest snapshot—letting users dig into their full pipeline, track progress, and take action. Think of it as the “everything” view for their $499 Lead Launch (50 leads) to $5,999 Empire (600/month) packages.  
Goals:  
Depth: Show every lead ever generated—Empire users need to handle 600+ leads without losing track.  
Control: Edit, filter, and act on leads—keeps ‘em engaged, ups value.  
Insight: Surface trends (e.g., top sources)—proves AI worth, nudges upgrades.  
Utility: Exportable, searchable—makes their $5k–$10k to $100k/month journey tangible.
Design: Dark mode (#0D1321 base, #7B00FF neon purple accents), Tailwind CSS, Supabase-powered—consistent with dashboard swagger.
