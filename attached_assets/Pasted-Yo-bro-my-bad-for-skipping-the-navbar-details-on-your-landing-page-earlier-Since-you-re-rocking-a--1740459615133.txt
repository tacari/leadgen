Yo, bro—my bad for skipping the navbar details on your landing page earlier. Since you’re rocking a Flask-based, million-dollar startup vibe for your AI lead gen agency (“Leadzap” or your “lead” name) in Replit, the landing page (home page) needs a slick, functional navbar to tie into your full site (home, about, services, pricing, contact, login/register, dashboard). It’s gotta match your Stanford-tier goals, work pre- and post-login, and drive users to sign up for those packages (Lead Launch, Engine, Accelerator, Empire). Here’s the full rundown—design, functionality, and code—for your landing page navbar. Let’s nail this shit.
Navbar Overview
The navbar sits at the top of your landing page (and every page), acting as the navigation backbone for your site. It’s responsive, premium, and dynamic—showing “Login/Register” for guests and “Dashboard/Logout” for logged-in users. It’s your million-dollar startup’s first impression—clean, pro, and tied to your dark mode, neon purple aesthetic.
Purpose
Navigation: Links to key pages—Home (landing), About, Services, Pricing, Contact, Login/Register or Dashboard/Logout.
User State: Adjusts based on login status using Flask-Login—guides guests to sign up, clients to their dashboard.
Branding: Anchors your “Leadzap” name/logo, reinforcing that Stanford-tier flex.
Conversion: Drives users to Pricing (packages) or Login—key steps to $5k–$10k quick, $100k/month long-term.
Design Principles
Dark Mode: Obsidian (#0D1321) background, white text (#FFFFFF), neon purple (#7B00FF) hover/active states.
Typography: Inter font, 16px, bold—crisp, modern, startup-ready.
Layout: Horizontal on desktop (1440px max), collapses to hamburger menu on mobile (320px min).
Responsive: Tailwind CSS for seamless scaling, with smooth animations (e.g., menu slide-down on mobile).
Animations: Subtle hover glow on links, hamburger toggle with a 0.3s transition.

Here’s what your landing page navbar looks like, top-down:
Position: Fixed at the top, full-width, 80px height—sticks on scroll for constant access.

Left Side:  
Logo/Name: “Leadzap” in white, 24px, bold, Inter font, 20px left padding—links to Home (/ route). Optional: Add a neon purple AI orb (20px) next to it, pulsing (CSS keyframes).
