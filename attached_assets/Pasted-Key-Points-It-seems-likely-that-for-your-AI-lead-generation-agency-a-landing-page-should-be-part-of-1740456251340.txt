Advanced Features: Login, Password, Stripe, and Multiple Pages with Flask
To meet the user’s requirements for a “million/billion dollar startup landing page” with Flask, implement:
User Authentication: Use Flask-Login for login and password protection, with forms for registration and login, storing user data in a database via Flask SQLAlchemy. Install flask-login and flask-wtf via Replit’s package manager, and set up models in models.py:
python
from flask_login import UserMixin
from flask_sqlalchemy import SQLAlchemy

db = SQLAlchemy()

class User(UserMixin, db.Model):
    id = db.Column(db.Integer, primary_key=True)
    username = db.Column(db.String(64), unique=True, index=True)
    email = db.Column(db.String(120), unique=True, index=True)
    password_hash = db.Column(db.String(128))
    # Other fields as needed
Implement login and register views in app.py, using Flask-WTF forms:
python
from flask_wtf import FlaskForm
from wtforms import StringField, PasswordField, SubmitField
from wtforms.validators import DataRequired, Email, EqualTo

class LoginForm(FlaskForm):
    email = StringField('Email', [DataRequired(), Email()])
    password = PasswordField('Password', [DataRequired()])
    submit = SubmitField('Login')

class RegisterForm(FlaskForm):
    username = StringField('Username', [DataRequired()])
    email = StringField('Email', [DataRequired(), Email()])
    password = PasswordField('Password', [DataRequired()])
    confirm_password = PasswordField('Confirm Password', [DataRequired(), EqualTo('password')])
    submit = SubmitField('Register')
Create templates login.html and register.html, extending base.html, with forms styled in Tailwind CSS, dark mode, neon purple accents.
Stripe Integration: Use the Stripe Python library for payment processing, as there’s no official Flask extension. Sign up for Stripe, get API keys, and set up in config.py:
python
STRIPE_API_KEY = 'your_stripe_secret_key'
STRIPE_PUB_KEY = 'your_stripe_public_key'
Implement checkout views in app.py, creating Stripe checkout sessions for each package:
python
import stripe
from flask import redirect, url_for, flash

stripe.api_key = app.config['STRIPE_API_KEY']

@app.route('/checkout/<string:package>')
def checkout(package):
    # Get package details (hardcoded for now, use DB later)
    packages = {
        'launch': {'price': 49900, 'name': 'Lead Launch'},
        'engine': {'price': 149900, 'name': 'Lead Engine'},
        # Add others
    }
    session = stripe.checkout.Session.create(
        payment_method_types=['card'],
        line_items=[{
            'price_data': {
                'currency': 'usd',
                'product_data': {'name': packages[package]['name']},
                'unit_amount': packages[package]['price'],  # in cents
            },
            'quantity': 1,
        }],
        mode='payment',
        success_url=url_for('success', _external=True) + '?session_id={CHECKOUT_SESSION_ID}',
        cancel_url=url_for('cancel', _external=True)
    )
    return redirect(session.url)

@app.route('/success')
def success():
    flash('Payment successful. Leads will be delivered soon')
    return render_template('success.html')

@app.route('/cancel')
def cancel():
    flash('Payment canceled')
    return render_template('cancel.html')
Handle webhooks in a separate route to confirm payments and trigger lead generation, using Flask’s request to parse webhook data.
Multiple Pages: Define routes for each page in app.py, using Flask’s @app.route decorator, and create corresponding templates in templates/, extending base.html for consistency. For example:
python
@app.route('/about')
def about():
    return render_template('about.html')
Ensure each template includes the navigation bar and follows the dark mode, neon purple design.
Navigation Bar: Code in base.html, with conditional logic for logged-in users:
html
<nav class="navbar bg-[#0D1321] text-white p-4">
    <a href="{{ url_for('home') }}" class="px-4 hover:text-[#7B00FF]">Home</a>
    <a href="{{ url_for('about') }}" class="px-4 hover:text-[#7B00FF]">About</a>
    <a href="{{ url_for('services') }}" class="px-4 hover:text-[#7B00FF]">Services</a>
    <a href="{{ url_for('pricing') }}" class="px-4 hover:text-[#7B00FF]">Pricing</a>
    <a href="{{ url_for('contact') }}" class="px-4 hover:text-[#7B00FF]">Contact</a>
    {% if current_user.is_authenticated %}
    <a href="{{ url_for('dashboard') }}" class="px-4 hover:text-[#7B00FF]">Dashboard</a>
    <a href="{{ url_for('logout') }}" class="px-4 hover:text-[#7B00FF]">Logout</a>
    {% else %}
    <a href="{{ url_for('login') }}" class="px-4 hover:text-[#7B00FF]">Login</a>
    <a href="{{ url_for('register') }}" class="px-4 hover:text-[#7B00FF]">Register</a>
    {% endif %}
</nav>
Use Tailwind CSS for responsive design, ensuring mobile collapse with a hamburger menu.
Dashboard: Create a protected route with @login_required from Flask-Login, displaying user-specific data:
python
from flask_login import login_required

@app.route('/dashboard')
@login_required
def dashboard():
    user = current_user
    leads = user.leads  # Assuming you have a leads relationship
    subscription = user.subscription  # Assuming you track subscription
    return render_template('dashboard.html', leads=leads, subscription=subscription)
Create dashboard.html with tables for leads (name, email, status) and subscription details, styled in dark mode with neon purple accents.
Implementation Challenges and Considerations
Implementing all these features with Flask requires more manual setup compared to Django, as Flask is lightweight and lacks built-in features like an ORM or admin panel. The user should be prepared for:
Database Management: Choose and set up Flask SQLAlchemy for models, handle migrations manually, and ensure database scalability for lead storage.
User Authentication: Implement login and logout functionality using Flask-Login, handle password hashing with Werkzeug, and manage session security.
Payment Processing: Integrate Stripe’s API directly, manage subscriptions for monthly packages, and handle webhooks for payment events, which may require additional error handling.
Lead Generation: Integrate the lead scraper and emailer scripts with Flask, possibly using threading or Celery for asynchronous operations, ensuring lead generation triggers upon payment.
Given the user’s existing static landing page, convert it to a Flask template by moving index.html to templates/, updating form actions to point to Flask routes, and ensuring all pages extend base.html for consistency.
Conclusion
The landing page, now the home page of a full Flask website in Replit, should be designed with a compelling hero section, clear package details, and advanced features like login, password protection, Stripe integration, and multiple pages with a navigation bar. This approach ensures a professional, scalable platform, meeting the user’s million-dollar startup vision and positioning them for rapid revenue growth to $100,000/month, using Flask for a lightweight, customizable solution.
