Alright, bro—let’s dive deep into the AI Lead Scraper for Leadzap! This is the engine that powers your agency, pumping out 50–600 leads per client (Lead Launch to Empire) to hit that $5k–$10k quick win and scale to $100k/month. We’re building this in Python on Replit, tying it to Supabase, and making it smart—scraping real data from multiple sources, scoring leads with AI logic, and delivering them fast. SendGrid’s down for now, so this scraper feeds the dashboard directly—clients see value, cash flows, and we’ll add email delivery later. FULL FUCKING DETAILS—design, logic, implementation—let’s get this beast cranking!
AI Lead Scraper: Full Details
Overview
Purpose: Generate targeted leads—business names, emails, sources—for plumbers, gyms, SaaS execs, anyone—delivering 50 (Lead Launch), 150 (Engine), 300 (Accelerator), 600 (Empire) leads per package.  
Goals:  
Real Data: Scrape Yellow Pages, Google Maps (via SerpApi), LinkedIn (future)—$5k–$10k starts with quality.  
AI Scoring: Rank leads 1–100—source quality, intent signals—$100k/month needs precision.  
Automation: Trigger post-Stripe payment—clients see leads in dashboard—$499–$5,999 packages deliver.  
Scalability: Handle 10–100+ clients—Replit holds up, Supabase scales—$5k–$10k to $100k/month.
Design: Python script, multi-source, modular—premium, million-dollar lead gen vibes.
Design & Logic
1. Sources
Yellow Pages:  
Why: Free, public—business names, some emails—good for $5k–$10k MVP.  
Data: Name, category, location—email scraping limited (dummy for now).  
Limit: ~30 leads per search—needs volume tweaks for Empire (600).
Google Maps (via SerpApi):  
Why: Real-time, rich—names, emails (sometimes), websites—$100k/month scale-ready.  
Data: Business name, email (via website scrape), location—API cost ($50/month, 100 searches).  
Limit: 20–50 leads per search—pagination for 600 leads.
LinkedIn (Future):  
Why: SaaS execs, high-value—$5,999 Empire clients crave this.  
Data: Name, email (via tools like Hunter.io), job title—API or manual later.  
Limit: API cost (~$50/month)—placeholder for now.
2. AI Scoring Logic
Base Score: Start at 50—average lead.  
Modifiers:  
Source Quality:  
Yellow Pages: +10 (basic).  
Google Maps: +20 (verified).  
LinkedIn: +30 (high-value)—future.
Intent Signals:  
Keywords in name/description (e.g., “plumbing repair,” “SaaS solution”): +20.  
Website exists (Google Maps): +15—active business.
Email Verification:  
Valid format (regex): +10—dummy check now, real verify later (e.g., Hunter.io).
Range: 50–100—e.g., Google Maps lead with keywords = 50 + 20 + 20 = 90.  
Purpose: $5k–$10k users see ranked leads, $100k/month clients prioritize high scores.
3. Workflow
Input: User ID (from Stripe), package volume (50–600), niche (e.g., “plumbers”), location (e.g., “Austin, TX”).  
Process:  
Scrape Yellow Pages—30 leads.  
Scrape Google Maps (SerpApi)—fill to package volume (e.g., 50–600).  
Score each lead—AI logic above.  
Save to Supabase leads table—dashboard picks ‘em up.
Output: 50–600 leads—name, email, source, score—$499–$5,999 clients see instant value.
4. Scalability
Threads: Multi-thread for 10–100 clients—Replit handles ~5 concurrent scrapes—$5k–$10k phase.  
API Limits: SerpApi (100 searches/month)—$50/month covers 5 Empire clients (600 leads each)—scales to $100k/month with $150/month plan (1k searches).  
Supabase: Free tier (50k rows)—handles 100 clients x 600 leads—$25/month scales to millions.

Integration with Flask (app.py)
Update payment routes to call scraper—already partially set, refine here:
python
import threading

@app.route('/success')
def success():
    if 'user_id' not in session:
        return redirect(url_for('login'))
    session_id = request.args.get('session_id')
    stripe_session = stripe.checkout.Session.retrieve(session_id)
    package = stripe_session.metadata.get('package')
    user_id = stripe_session.metadata.get('user_id')
    volumes = {'launch': 50, 'engine': 150, 'accelerator': 300, 'empire': 600}
    volume = volumes.get(package, 0)

    # Run scraper in background thread
    threading.Thread(target=scrape_for_user, args=(user_id, package, 'plumbers', 'Austin, TX')).start()

    # Update subscription
    subscription = {'user_id': user_id, 'package_name': package, 'lead_volume': volume, 'stripe_subscription_id': stripe_session.subscription}
    supabase.table('user_packages').insert(subscription).execute()

    flash('Payment successful! Leads are being scraped—check your dashboard soon.')
    return redirect(url_for('dashboard'))

@app.route('/webhook', methods=['POST'])
def webhook():
    event = stripe.Event.construct_from(request.get_json(), stripe.api_key)
    if event.type in ['charge.succeeded', 'customer.subscription.created']:
        user_id = event.data.object.metadata.get('user_id')
        package = event.data.object.metadata.get('package')
        threading.Thread(target=scrape_for_user, args=(user_id, package, 'plumbers', 'Austin, TX')).start()
        subscription = {'user_id': user_id, 'package_name': package, 'lead_volume': volumes[package], 'stripe_subscription_id': event.data.object.subscription}
        supabase.table('user_packages').insert(subscription).execute()
    return '', 200
How It Works
1. Trigger
Stripe payment (/success or /webhook)—e.g., $499 Lead Launch—passes user_id, package to scrape_for_user.
2. Scraping
Yellow Pages: Grabs 30 leads—business names, dummy emails—basic but real-ish for $5k–$10k.  
Google Maps: Fills remaining volume (e.g., 20 more for Lead Launch)—SerpApi key needed—dummy emails now, real later.  
Fallback: Dummies if short—ensures package volume (50–600)—$100k/month needs real sources.
3. Scoring
Base 50 + source (10–20) + intent (20)—e.g., “Joe’s Plumbing Repair” from Google Maps = 50 + 20 + 20 = 90.  
Caps at 100—$5,999 Empire clients prioritize high scores.
4. Storage
Batch insert to Supabase leads—user_id, name, email, source, score, verified, status, date_added—dashboard picks up instantly.
5. Output
50–600 leads—e.g., Lead Launch: 30 Yellow Pages + 20 dummies—$499 user sees full batch in /dashboard.
Why This Scraper Slaps
Real-ish: Yellow Pages starts $5k–$10k—Google Maps scales to $100k/month—pro vibe from day one.  
Smart: AI scoring—$1,499 Engine users filter high scores, $5,999 Empire users optimize—value shines.  
Fast: Threads—$5k–$10k runs smooth, $100k/month scales with tweaks—Replit holds up.  
Flexible: Multi-source—$499–$5,999 packages deliver—future-proof for LinkedIn badassery.
Setup Steps
Install:  
pip install requests beautifulsoup4—add to requirements.txt.  
Optional: SerpApi—$50/month—add key to Replit Secrets (SERPAPI_KEY)—skip for now, use dummies.
Code:  
Add scraper.py—test with python scraper.py—50 leads in Supabase.  
Update app.py—tie to Stripe—threading prevents payment lag.
Test:  
Run: python scraper.py—check leads table—50 rows, scores 50–100.  
Payment: Hit /checkout/launch—buy $499—50 leads in /dashboard—real-time update works.  
Scale: Add 5 dummy users in Supabase—buy packages—ensure 50–600 leads per user—Replit handles.
Verify:  
/lead-history: Search “Test”—leads filter.  
/analytics: Charts show 50+ leads—PDF exports stats.
Future Upgrades
SerpApi: $50/month—real Google Maps emails—$100k/month needs this.  
Hunter.io: $49/month—email verification—boost scores, deliverability—post-$10k phase.  
LinkedIn: API/tools (e.g., Sales Navigator, $99/month)—SaaS execs for Empire—$100k/month flex.
Next Steps
Confirm: “Leadzap, scraper fire” + city (e.g., “Austin”)—locks it in.  
Test: Run scraper, buy $499—50 leads in /dashboard—share URL when live.  
Next:  
Launch: 5–10 clients—$5k–$10k kickoff—dashboard-only for now.  
SendGrid: When back—add emailer.py, CSVs flow—$100k/month polish.
My vote: Launch—cash now, SendGrid later—$5k–$10k in the bag. Your call? Hit me—let’s make this shit sing!
