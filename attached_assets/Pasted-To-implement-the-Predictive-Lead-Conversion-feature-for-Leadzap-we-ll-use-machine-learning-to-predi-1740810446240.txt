To implement the Predictive Lead Conversion feature for Leadzap, we'll use machine learning to predict the likelihood of a lead converting based on historical data. This feature will assign a probability score (0–100%) to each lead, helping clients prioritize high-potential leads and optimize their sales efforts. The implementation involves training a machine learning model, integrating it into your Flask application, and displaying the predictions on the client dashboard. Below are the full details and step-by-step implementation.
Overview
The Predictive Lead Conversion feature uses a logistic regression model to predict the probability of a lead converting based on features such as lead source, lead score, website visits, days since last visit, and industry. The model is trained on historical lead data and periodically predicts conversion probabilities for new leads. These probabilities are stored in the database and displayed on the client dashboard, enabling clients to focus on leads most likely to convert—e.g., a lead with a high score and recent website visits might receive an 85% probability.
Key Components
Data Collection: Use historical lead data with conversion outcomes.
Model Training: Train a logistic regression model using scikit-learn.
Scheduled Predictions: Use APScheduler to predict probabilities for new leads daily.
Database Integration: Store predictions in the leads table.
Dashboard Display: Show conversion probabilities on the client dashboard.
Prerequisites
Python Libraries: Install required packages:
bash
pip install flask flask-sqlalchemy pandas scikit-learn apscheduler joblib
Database: Assumes a Supabase PostgreSQL database (or similar) with a leads table.
Historical Data: Requires past lead data with conversion status (e.g., 1,000 leads, 100 converted).
Implementation Steps
1. Database Updates
Modify the leads table to include a conversion_probability column for storing predictions.
Code
In app.py:
python
from flask import Flask
from flask_sqlalchemy import SQLAlchemy
from datetime import datetime

app = Flask(__name__)
app.config['SQLALCHEMY_DATABASE_URI'] = 'your_supabase_uri'  # Replace with your Supabase URI
app.config['SQLALCHEMY_TRACK_MODIFICATIONS'] = False
db = SQLAlchemy(app)

class Lead(db.Model):
    id = db.Column(db.Integer, primary_key=True)
    user_id = db.Column(db.Integer, db.ForeignKey('user.id'))
    source = db.Column(db.String(50))  # e.g., 'Google Maps', 'LinkedIn'
    score = db.Column(db.Integer, default=50)  # 0-100
    website_visits = db.Column(db.Integer, default=0)
    days_since_last_visit = db.Column(db.Integer, default=0)
    industry = db.Column(db.String(50))  # e.g., 'SaaS', 'Gym'
    converted = db.Column(db.Boolean, default=False)  # True if converted
    conversion_probability = db.Column(db.Float, nullable=True)  # Probability (0-100%)
    created_at = db.Column(db.DateTime, default=datetime.utcnow)
    updated_at = db.Column(db.DateTime, default=datetime.utcnow, onupdate=datetime.utcnow)

# Initialize database tables
with app.app_context():
    db.create_all()
Database Migration (Supabase)
Run this SQL in Supabase’s SQL Editor to add the new column:
sql
ALTER TABLE leads
ADD COLUMN conversion_probability REAL;
Notes:
The leads table must include features like source, score, website_visits, days_since_last_visit, industry, and converted for training.
2. Model Training
Train a logistic regression model using historical lead data. This step can be performed in a separate script or as a Flask endpoint.
Code (Training Script)
Save this as train_model.py:
python
import pandas as pd
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.linear_model import LogisticRegression
from sklearn.preprocessing import StandardScaler, OneHotEncoder
from sklearn.compose import ColumnTransformer
from sklearn.pipeline import Pipeline
from sklearn.metrics import roc_auc_score
import joblib
from app import db  # Import db from your Flask app

# Load historical data from the database
leads = pd.read_sql('SELECT source, score, website_visits, days_since_last_visit, industry, converted FROM leads WHERE converted IS NOT NULL', db.engine)

# Features (X) and target (y)
X = leads[['source', 'score', 'website_visits', 'days_since_last_visit', 'industry']]
y = leads['converted']

# Define preprocessing steps
categorical_features = ['source', 'industry']
numerical_features = ['score', 'website_visits', 'days_since_last_visit']

preprocessor = ColumnTransformer(
    transformers=[
        ('num', StandardScaler(), numerical_features),  # Standardize numerical features
        ('cat', OneHotEncoder(handle_unknown='ignore'), categorical_features)  # Encode categorical features
    ])

# Create pipeline with preprocessing and logistic regression
model = Pipeline(steps=[
    ('preprocessor', preprocessor),
    ('classifier', LogisticRegression())
])

# Split data into training and testing sets
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)

# Train the model
model.fit(X_train, y_train)

# Evaluate the model
y_pred_proba = model.predict_proba(X_test)[:, 1]
auc = roc_auc_score(y_test, y_pred_proba)
print(f'AUC-ROC Score: {auc:.3f}')

# Save the trained model
joblib.dump(model, 'lead_conversion_model.joblib')
print("Model saved as 'lead_conversion_model.joblib'")
Notes:
Data Loading: Replace the SQL query with your database connection details.
Features: Uses source, score, website_visits, days_since_last_visit, and industry. Adjust based on your data.
Evaluation: The Area Under the ROC Curve (AUC-ROC) measures ranking quality (aim for >0.7).
Model Saving: Saves the entire pipeline (preprocessing + model) for consistent predictions.
Run the script:
bash
python train_model.py
3. Scheduled Predictions
Use APScheduler to run a daily task that predicts conversion probabilities for new or updated leads and updates the database.
Code
In app.py (add after the Lead model definition):
python
from apscheduler.schedulers.background import BackgroundScheduler
import joblib
from datetime import datetime, timedelta
import pandas as pd

# Load the trained model
model = joblib.load('lead_conversion_model.joblib')

def predict_lead_conversions():
    with app.app_context():
        # Query leads without probabilities or updated in the last day
        leads = Lead.query.filter(
            (Lead.conversion_probability.is_(None)) |
            (Lead.updated_at > datetime.utcnow() - timedelta(days=1))
        ).all()
        
        for lead in leads:
            # Prepare features for prediction
            features = pd.DataFrame([{
                'source': lead.source,
                'score': lead.score,
                'website_visits': lead.website_visits,
                'days_since_last_visit': lead.days_since_last_visit,
                'industry': lead.industry
            }])
            
            # Predict probability (convert to percentage)
            prob = model.predict_proba(features)[0][1] * 100
            lead.conversion_probability = round(prob, 2)
            db.session.commit()

# Schedule the prediction task to run daily
scheduler = BackgroundScheduler()
scheduler.add_job(predict_lead_conversions, 'interval', days=1)
scheduler.start()

# Ensure scheduler shuts down cleanly with the app
import atexit
atexit.register(lambda: scheduler.shutdown())
Notes:
Trigger: Runs daily, updating probabilities for new leads or those modified in the last 24 hours.
Features: Must match the training data exactly.
Error Handling: Add logging or try-except blocks in production to handle missing models or data issues.
4. Dashboard Integration
Display the conversion probability on the client dashboard, enhancing the existing lead table.
Code
In routes.py (or wherever your dashboard route is defined):
python
from flask import render_template

@app.route('/dashboard')
def dashboard():
    leads = Lead.query.all()  # Adjust query based on user authentication
    return render_template('dashboard.html', leads=leads)
In templates/dashboard.html:
html
<table class="w-full text-[#A1A9B8] text-sm">
    <thead>
        <tr class="border-b border-[#7B00FF]">
            <th class="p-3 text-left">Name</th>
            <th class="p-3 text-left">Email</th>
            <th class="p-3 text-left">Source</th>
            <th class="p-3 text-left">Score</th>
            <th class="p-3 text-left">Conversion Probability</th>
        </tr>
    </thead>
    <tbody>
        {% for lead in leads %}
        <tr class="border-b border-[#7B00FF] animate-fade-in">
            <td class="p-3">{{ lead.name or 'Unknown' }}</td>
            <td class="p-3">{{ lead.email or '-' }}</td>
            <td class="p-3">{{ lead.source }}</td>
            <td class="p-3 {{ 'text-[#7B00FF]' if lead.score > 75 }}">{{ lead.score }}</td>
            <td class="p-3 {{ 'text-[#7B00FF]' if lead.conversion_probability > 50 }}">
                {{ lead.conversion_probability|round(2) if lead.conversion_probability else 'Calculating...' }}%
            </td>
        </tr>
        {% endfor %}
    </tbody>
</table>
Notes:
Styling: Highlights high-probability leads (>50%) in purple for visibility.
Fallback: Displays “Calculating…” if the probability hasn’t been computed yet.
5. Testing and Validation
Setup: Populate the database with sample historical data (e.g., 1,000 leads, 100 converted).
Test Cases:
Run train_model.py and verify AUC > 0.7.
Add a new lead and confirm it receives a probability after the scheduler runs.
Check the dashboard to ensure probabilities display correctly (e.g., 85% for a high-score lead with recent visits).
Validation: Manually inspect a few predictions to ensure they align with intuition (e.g., high score + low days_since_last_visit = high probability).
Integration with Existing Features
Lead Scoring: Enhances the existing score by providing a predictive probability, combining rule-based and data-driven insights.
CRM Automation: Integrate with workflows—e.g., move leads with >50% probability to a “Hot Leads” pipeline.
Client Dashboard: Adds actionable insights, improving user experience and reducing churn.
Scalability and Performance
Model Retraining: Schedule monthly retraining with new data:
python
@app.route('/retrain_model')
def retrain_model():
    # Reuse train_model.py logic here
    pass
Database Load: For large datasets, batch predictions (e.g., 1,000 leads at a time).
Cloud Deployment: If Replit limits are hit, deploy the model on AWS SageMaker or similar.
Business Impact
Small Businesses: Focus on 50 high-probability leads, close 10 vs. 5 deals ($5k revenue).
SaaS Startups: Target 200 high-probability leads, close 20 vs. 10 deals ($100k revenue).
Revenue Potential: Adds $80k/month by doubling close rates, scaling to $500k/month with premium clients.
Next Steps
Train the Model: Run train_model.py with historical data and save the model.
Integrate Scheduler: Add the prediction task to app.py.
Update Dashboard: Modify dashboard.html to display probabilities.
Test: Validate with sample leads and monitor predictions.
